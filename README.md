# Odin Recipes Project
<p>A basic website that displays different types of recipes for food.
This website is a project to demonstrate and put into practice the basics of HTML.</p>

<p>Some of the features used to make this site is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Features will be added here as time goes on</li>
</ul>

<p>For now, it won't look the prettiest, but it'll serve the basic purpose of displaying the information and navigating through the pages. In the future, I plan to come back to it and touch it up with CSS.</p>
