    <h2>Chocolate-Banana Protein Shake</h2>
    <p>This personal chocolate-banana protein shake of mine is something that I've been having for almost two years now.
      I'm a fairly picky eater so I don't stick to things unless they taste good, so you know this tastes that good.
      It contains roughly 600 calories and a whopping 61 grams of protein!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 banana</li>
      <li>2 scoops of vanilla whey protein powder</li>
      <li>250ml 1% milk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cocoa powder</li>
      <li>a pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut your banana into smaller pieces, around 5 or 6.</li>
      <li>Place them into a blender. Your blender should be able to hold at least 600 ml!</li>
      <li>Add your milk to the blender</li>
      <li>Add your protein powder</li>
      <li>Add your cocoa powder, and gently shake to mix the powder well.</li>
      <li>Mix with the blender, shake as it mixes</li>
      <li>Pour it into a cup, and then you're done!</li>
    </ol>
