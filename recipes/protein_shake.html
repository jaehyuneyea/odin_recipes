    <h2>Chocolate-Banana Protein Shake</h2>
    <p>This personal chocolate-banana protein shake of mine is something that I've been having for almost two years now.
      I'm a fairly picky eater so I don't stick to things unless they taste good, so you know this tastes that good.
      It contains roughly 600 calories and a whopping 61 grams of protein!
